Nodes to add/have:
	Concatentation (dynamic to number of streams required)
		with transition support
	Stream Splitter (again dynamic; as many splits as required, and hence will output (no splits + 1) number of streams)
	Subtitle injector
	Audio Video Splitter
	Video Layering
		With different layering methods e.g. add, subtract, difference, etc.
	Text Overlay
	Colour Grading
	Audio volume modulator
	Audio equaliser
		+ presets
	Audio layering (add two audio streams together)
	Audio volume normaliser
	Video Masking
	Video Alpha Masking
	Video Color to Alpha
	Shape generation - ellipse, polygon
		Also allow SVG path import?
	Video opacity
	Video Transform (position, rotation, scale, 3d skew, curving of video, etc)
	Video Border
	Video Blur
	Video Speed
	Audio Speed
	Audio Pitch modulator
	Audio BG noise removal
	Video Green Screen removal
	Video RGB splitter
	Video RGB merger
	Audio -> text voice recognition?
	Video: get nth frame/get frame at timestamp/get frame by %
	Audio gain - allow clipping
	Video upscale/downscaler


	Video - Object Tracking - would also require new stream type of number (which would therefore mean implcitly 2 streams of numbers for the two axes) - these could be used for transform numbers?
		This same idea of number streaming could be used to power keyframing. 

	Subtitle auto-translator?

	Video - auto-deepfake

	Subtitle/Text -> text-to-speech

	Video colorizer

	



	Media import will now output a 'container', then you will use the following to get the raw streams:
		Container video-only splitter - outputs one container per-video, with all the audio streams + that particular video stream attached
		Container splitter - outputs all the video + audio streams
		Audio + video merger - will merge one video stream with one or more audio streams
		Stream merge - will merge any number of video + audio streams into one container



	Keyframer - per-composited node?
